I'm Gonna write a description here. 👊
```

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) with App Router and React Server Components
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) with [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components
- **Database**: [Neon Postgres](https://neon.tech/) (serverless Postgres)
- **ORM**: [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/)
- **Validation**: [Zod](https://zod.dev/) for form and API validation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- A PostgreSQL database (Neon recommended and used for this project) for `DATABASE_URL`

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Environment Setup

1. Copy the example environment file:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # or on Windows
   copy .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit the `.env` file with your credentials (see [.env.example](.env.example) for details):
   - `DATABASE_URL` - Postgres connection URL for Neon

> **Note:** Both `.env` and `.env.local` are required because Drizzle’s migration tooling does not fully support `.env.local` on its own.

### Database Setup

This project uses Drizzle ORM with Neon Postgres. After installing dependencies and setting up your environment, you can run these commands:

1. **Generate migrations** - Creates SQL migration files based on your schema changes:

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit generate
   ```

2. **Apply migrations** - Runs the migration files against your database to update the schema:

   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit migrate
   ```

3. **Drizzle Studio** - Starts a local web interface to browse your database:
   ```bash
   npx drizzle-kit studio
   ```

### Running the Application

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Start the production server:

```bash
npm start
```
